---

<a name="Overview" ></a>
## Overview ##

**ASP.NET Core 1.0** is a new [open-source](https://github.com/aspnet/home) and cross-platform framework for building modern cloud-based Web applications using .NET. It was built from the ground up to provide an optimized development framework for apps that are either deployed to the cloud or run on-premises. It consists of modular components with minimal overhead, so you retain flexibility while constructing your solutions. You can develop and run your ASP.NET Core 1.0 applications cross-platform on Windows, Mac and Linux.

ASP.NET Core 1.0 is built with the needs of modern Web applications in mind, including a unified story for building Web UI and Web APIs that integrate with today’s modern client-side frameworks and development workflows. It's also built to be cloud-ready by introducing environment-based configuration and by providing built-in dependency injection support.

This module demonstrates how to create a simple **ASP.NET Core 1.0** project using **Visual Studio 2015** in **Windows**, as well as a simple web application using **Yeoman** and **Visual Studio Code** in **Ubuntu**.

### Exercise 1: Creating a new web site with Visual Studio 2015 ###

In this exercise, you'll create a new ASP.NET Core 1.0 Web Application project in Visual Studio 2015. You'll then explore the generated solution, and see it in action.

<a name="Ex1Task1" ></a>
#### Task 1 - Creating a site using the Web Application project template ####

In this task, you'll create a new Web site in Visual Studio based on the **ASP.NET Core 1.0 Web Application** project template.

1. Open **Visual Studio Community 2015** and select **File | New | Project...** to create a new solution.

1. In the **New Project** dialog box, select **ASP.NET Web Application** under the **Visual C# | Web** tab, and make sure **.NET Framework 4.6** is selected. Name the project _MyWebApp_, choose a **Location** and click **OK**.

	![New ASP.NET Web Application project](Images/creating-new-aspnet-web-application-project.png?raw=true "New ASP.NET Web Application project")

	_Creating a new ASP.NET Web Application project_

1. In the **New ASP.NET Project** dialog box, select the **Web Application** template under **ASP.NET 5 Templates**. Also, make sure that the **Authentication** option is set to **Individual User Accounts**. Click **OK** to continue.

	![Creating a new project with the Web Application template](Images/creating-a-new-aspnet-project.png?raw=true "Creating a new project with the Web Application template")

	_Creating a new project with the Web Application template_

1. Once the project is created you can proceed to explore the generated solution.

	![Exploring the generated solution](Images/exploring-the-generated-solution.png?raw=true "Exploring the generated solution")

	_Exploring the generated solution_

1. The following is a brief description of the components you can find in the generated solution:

	* **global.json:** This file is used to configure the solution as a whole. It includes just two sections, projects and sdk by default.
	* **References**: This folder details the server-side references for the project which might be assemblies, NuGet packages, or other projects.
	* **wwwroot:** This special folder represents the actual root of the web application when running on a web server. Resources like images, script files and stylesheets are located inside this folder.
	* **Dependencies:** This section contains two subfolders: **Bower** and **NPM**. These folders correspond to two package managers by the same names and they’re used to pull in client-side dependencies and tools.
	* **Migrations:** This folder contains the Entity Framework migrations. This folder is added when the **Individual User Accounts** authentication option is selected during the configuration of the project template.
	* **Models:** This folder will contain the classes that represent your application data.
	* **Controllers**, **ViewModels**, **Views** and **Services**: These folders are related with **ASP.NET MVC** components. Except for the Controllers folder, these folders are added when the **Individual User Accounts** authentication option is selected during the configuration of the project template. You'll explore the MVC and Web API technologies in the next exercises.
	* **appsettings.json:** This file contains the configurations like connection strings and logging levels.
	* **gulpfile.js:** This file contains the Gulp tasks for the project.
	* **project.json:** This file is used to define the project’s server side dependencies, as well as other project-specific information.
	* **Startup.cs:** class file wires up configuration, MVC, EF, Identity services, logging, routes, and more. It provides a good example on how to configure the services used by your ASP.NET application.

1. Expand the **Dependencies** node and inside it the **Bower** node. Right-click jquery and notice that it's possible to uninstall or update a package through the context menu. This will automatically remove or update the package from the corresponding JSON file.

	![The Dependencies context menu](Images/dependencies-context-command.png?raw=true "The Dependencies context menu")

	_The Dependencies context menu_

1. Click **Manage Bower Packages...** to open the Bower Package Manager UI. Here, you can update your installed packages, remove them or install new packages. For more information about bower, you can check their site at [http://bower.io/](http://bower.io/).

	![The Bower package manager UI](Images/bower-package-manager-ui.png?raw=true "The Bower package manager UI")

	_The Bower package manager UI_

1. Open the **_Layout.cshtml** file located inside the _Views/Shared_ folder, to explore the layout of the page. This page is using a new Razor language feature in ASP.NET Core called [TagHelpers](https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro.html). TagHelpers allow creating tags - or extending HTML tags - with server-side logic. Notice in the example below how that some of the the `link` tags include some additional attributes such as `aspnet-fallback-href`. The `link` TagHelper evaluates these on the server and creates JavaScript code which tests if CDN resources are unavailable and, if so, loads local copies of those files. These tags are wrapped in `environment` tags, which are evaluated on the server. The result of the environment tags below is that you will always load local resources when developing, but will attempt to leverage CDN resources in staging and production.

	````HTML
    <environment names="Development">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css" />
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.css" />
    </environment>
    <environment names="Staging,Production">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css"
              asp-fallback-href="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
              asp-fallback-test-class="sr-only" asp-fallback-test-property="position" asp-fallback-test-value="absolute" />
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.min.css" asp-append-version="true" />
    </environment>
    ````

1. Open the **Startup.cs** file. In this class you'll find the **Configure** method which is used to wire up your Web site's configuration.

	> **Note:** ASP.NET Core 1.0 assumes that no frameworks are being used unless you explicitly configure it in the **Configure** method. This enables you to have full control over the HTTP pipeline.

	![The Configure method](Images/configure-method.png?raw=true "The Configure method")

	_The Configure method_

1. At the end of the **Configure** method, you'll find the required code to map HTTP routes to **controllers**.

	<!-- mark:5-10 -->
	````C#
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
    {
        // ...

        app.UseMvc(routes =>
        {
            routes.MapRoute(
                name: "default",
                template: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
        });
    }
	````

1. The **ConfigureServices** method should be used to configure the services used by your application. You'll notice that ASP.NET Core 1.0 supports Dependency Injection natively.

	![The ConfigureServices method](Images/configureservices-method.png?raw=true "The ConfigureServices method")

	_The ConfigureServices method_

1. Open the **HomeController.cs** file in the **Controllers** folder. ASP.NET MVC 6 supports regular controllers (inheriting from the **Controller** base type) and POCO controllers.

1. Press **F5** to build and run the solution.

### Exercise 2: Working with Data ###

In this exercise, you'll take advantage of the ASP.NET Scaffolding framework provided by Visual Studio to create an ASP.NET MVC controller (and actions) and Razor views to perform CRUD operations, without writing a single line of code. The scaffolding process will use Entity Framework Code First to generate the data context and the database schema in the SQL database.

**About Entity Framework Code First**

Entity Framework (EF) is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that enables you to create data access applications by programming with a conceptual application model instead of programming directly using a relational storage schema.

The Entity Framework Code First modeling workflow allows you to use your own domain classes to represent the model that EF relies on when performing queries, change-tracking and updating functions. Using the Code First development workflow, you do not need to begin your application by creating a database or specifying a schema. Instead, you can write standard .NET classes that define the most appropriate domain model objects for your application, and Entity Framework will create the database for you.

> **Note:** You can learn more about Entity Framework [here](http://www.asp.net/entity-framework).

<a name="Ex2Task1" ></a>
#### Task 1 - Creating a New Model ####

The first step is to define a **Person** class which will be the model used by the scaffolding process to create the MVC controller and the views.

1. Open **Visual Studio Community 2015** and the **MyWebApp.sln** solution located in the **Source/Ex1/End** folder. Alternatively, you can continue with the solution that you obtained in the previous exercise.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **Models** folder of the **MyWebApp** project and select **Add | Class...**, name the file _Person.cs_ and click **Add**.

1. Replace the content of the **Person.cs** file with the following code. Press **CTRL + S** to save the changes.

	(Code Snippet - _IntroASPNETCore - Ex2 - PersonClass_)
	<!-- mark:1-11 -->
	````C#
    namespace MyWebApp.Models
    {
        public class Person
        {
            public int Id { get; set; }

            public string Name { get; set; }

            public int Age { get; set; }
        }
    }
	````

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **MyWebApp** project and select **Build**, or press **CTRL + SHIFT + B** to build the project.

<a name="Ex2Task2" ></a>
#### Task 2 - Creating an MVC Controller ####

Now that the **Person** model has been created, you'll use ASP.NET MVC scaffolding with Entity Framework to create the CRUD controller, actions and views.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **Controllers** folder of the **MyWebApp** project and select **Add | New Scaffolded Item...**.

1. In the **Add Scaffold** dialog box, select **MVC 6 Controller with views, using Entity Framework** and then click **Add.**

	![Selecting MVC 6 Controller with views and Entity Framework](Images/selecting-mvc-6-controller.png?raw=true "Selecting MVC 6 Controller with views and Entity Framework")

	_Selecting MVC 6 Controller with views and Entity Framework_

1. Select the **Use async controller actions** option and select **Person (MyWebApp.Models)** as the **Model class**. Under **Data context class**, click **New data context** button and name it _PeopleContext_.

	![Adding an MVC controller with scaffolding](Images/adding-an-mvc-controller-with-scaffolding.png?raw=true "Adding an MVC controller with scaffolding")

	_Adding an MVC controller with scaffolding_

1. Click **Add** to complete the process. Visual Studio will then generate the required controller, actions, data context and the Razor views associated with the default CRUD operations of the Person entity.

	![After creating the MVC controller with scaffolding](Images/after-creating-the-mvc-controller-with-scaffo.png?raw=true "After creating the MVC controller with scaffolding")

	_After creating the MVC controller with scaffolding_

1. Open the **PeopleController.cs** file in the **Controllers** folder. Notice that the CRUD action methods have been generated automatically.

	````C#
    // ...

    // POST: People/Create
    [HttpPost]
    [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Create(Person person)
    {
        if (ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            _context.Person.Add(person);
            await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
            return RedirectToAction("Index");
        }
        return View(person);
    }

    // GET: People/Edit/5
    public async Task<IActionResult> Edit(int? id)
    {
        if (id == null)
        {
            return HttpNotFound();
        }

        Person person = await _context.Person.SingleAsync(m => m.Id == id);
        if (person == null)
        {
            return HttpNotFound();
        }
        return View(person);
    }

    // ...
	````

	> **Note:** By selecting the **Use async controller actions** check box from the scaffolding options in the previous steps, Visual Studio generates asynchronous action methods for all actions that involve access to the Person data context. It's recommended that you use asynchronous action methods for long-running, non-CPU bound requests to avoid blocking the Web server from performing work while the request is being processed.

<a name="Ex2Task3" ></a>
#### Task 3 - Running the Solution ####

In this task, you'll run the solution again to verify the work done on the previous tasks. You will also add a new person and verify it was successfully saved to the database.

1. Press **F5** to run the solution.

1. Navigate to **/People** to see the list of people. Since the database is currently empty you'll see an empty list.

1. Explore the scaffolded views and actions. You can create a new Person, see its details, edit it and remove it.

	![Navigating to the scaffolded MVC views](Images/navigating-to-the-scaffolded-mvc-views.png?raw=true)

	_Navigating to the scaffolded MVC views_

1. Go back to Visual Studio and press **SHIFT + F5** to stop debugging.

<a name="Exercise3" ></a>
### Exercise 3: Unit testing your apps ###

Having a suite of automated tests is one of the best ways to ensure a software application does what its authors intended it to do. ASP.NET Core has been designed with testability in mind, so that creating unit tests for your applications is easier than ever before.

In this exercise, you'll add a test project to your solution and then run unit tests using Visual Studio.

<a name="Ex3Task1" ></a>
#### Task 1 - Creating the test project ####

A test project is just a class library with references to a test runner and the project being tested (also referred to as the System Under Test or SUT). It’s a good idea to organize your test projects in a separate folder from your SUT projects.

In this task, you'll create a test project in an ASP.NET Core solution.

1. Open **Visual Studio Community 2015** and the **MyWebApp.sln** solution located in the **Source/Ex2/End** folder. Alternatively, you can continue with the solution that you obtained in the previous exercise.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **solution** root, select **Add | New Solution folder** and name the folder _test_.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **test** folder, select **Add | New Project...** and to create a new project called **MyWebApp.UnitTests** using the **Class Library (Package)** project template.


	![MyWebApp.UnitTests class library project](Images/unit-test-class-library-project.png?raw=true "MyWebApp.UnitTests class library project")

	_MyWebApp.UnitTests class library project_

1. Delete the **Class1.cs** file from the new project.

1. Open the **project.json** file and replace the **net451** and **dotnet5.4** frameworks with **dnx451** and **dnxcore50**. After applying these changes, the **project.json** file should be similar to the following.

	````JSON
	{
	 "version": "1.0.0-*",
	 "description": "MyWebApp.UnitTests Class Library",
	 "authors": [ "" ],
	 "tags": [ "" ],
	 "projectUrl": "",
	 "licenseUrl": "",

	 "frameworks": {
		"dnx451": { },
		"dnxcore50": {
		  "dependencies": {
			 "Microsoft.CSharp": "4.0.1-beta-23516",
			 "System.Collections": "4.0.11-beta-23516",
			 "System.Linq": "4.0.1-beta-23516",
			 "System.Runtime": "4.0.21-beta-23516",
			 "System.Threading": "4.0.11-beta-23516"
		  }
		}
	 }
	}
	````

1. Add a reference to **xunit** and **xunit.runner.dnx**, version "2.1.0-*" for both packages and ensure they restore successfully. You can do this using the **NuGet Package Manager** or by adding them to the **dependencies** node of the **project.json** file.

	````
	"dependencies": {
	  "xunit": "2.1.0",
	  "xunit.runner.dnx": "2.1.0-*"
	}
	````

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **References** folder inside the **MyWebApp.UnitTests** and select **Add Reference...** to add the reference to the **MyWebApp** project. You can also do the same by adding the **MyWebApp** project in the **dependencies** node of the **project.json** file.

	````
	"dependencies": {
	  "MyWebApp": "1.0.0-*",
	  "xunit": "2.1.0",
	  "xunit.runner.dnx": "2.1.0-*"
	}
	````

1. Now, in the **project.json** file, add a new command named **test** with the value **xunit.runner.dnx** by adding the following node at the same level of the **dependencies** node.

	````
	"commands": {
	  "test": "xunit.runner.dnx"
	}
	````

1. The updated **project.json** file should look like the following code snippet.

	````
	{
	  "version": "1.0.0-*",
	  "description": "MyWebApp.UnitTests Class Library",
	  "authors": [ "" ],
	  "tags": [ "" ],
	  "projectUrl": "",
	  "licenseUrl": "",

	  "frameworks": {
		 "dnx451": { },
		 "dnxcore50": {
			"dependencies": {
			  "Microsoft.CSharp": "4.0.1-beta-23516",
			  "System.Collections": "4.0.11-beta-23516",
			  "System.Linq": "4.0.1-beta-23516",
			  "System.Runtime": "4.0.21-beta-23516",
			  "System.Threading": "4.0.11-beta-23516"
			}
		 }
	  },
	  "dependencies": {
		 "MyWebApp": "1.0.0-*",
		 "xunit": "2.1.0",
		 "xunit.runner.dnx": "2.1.0-*"
	  },
	  "commands": {
		 "test": "xunit.runner.dnx"
	  }
	}
	````

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **MyWebApp.UnitTests** project and select **Add | Class...**, name the file _MyTest.cs_ and click **Add**.

1. Add a method `public void MyFirstTest()` and decorate it with the `[Fact]` attribute, importing any required namespaces as you go

1. Inside the **MyFirstTest** method, add a simple true assertion to have a passing test, e.g. `Assert.Equal(1, 1);`

	````C#
	[Fact]
	public void MyFirstTest()
	{
		Assert.Equal(1, 1);
	}
	````

1. Now, add a failing test. The class should look like the following code snippet.

	````C#
	using Xunit;

	namespace MyWebApp.UnitTests
	{
		 public class MyTest
		 {
			  [Fact]
			  public void MyFirstTest()
			  {
					Assert.Equal(1, 1);
			  }

			  [Fact]
			  public void MyFirstFailingTest()
			  {
					Assert.Equal(1, 2);
			  }
		 }
	}
	````

1. Open the **Test Explorer** window. To do this, go to **Test > Windows > Test Explorer**.

1. Build the solution and your tests should appear.

1. Run the test by pressing the **Run All** button in **Test Explorer**.

### Exercise 4: Cross-platform development ###

To appeal to a broader audience of developers, **ASP.NET Core 1.0** supports cross-platform development on Windows, Mac and Linux. The entire ASP.NET Core 1.0 stack is open source and encourages community contributions and engagement. ASP.NET Core 1.0 comes with a new, agile project system in Visual Studio while also providing a complete command-line interface so that you can develop using the tools of your choice.

In this exercise, you'll create a new project and run it in **Ubuntu** 14.04 using the terminal and **Visual Studio Code**.

<a name="Ex4Task1" ></a>
#### Task 1 - Creating the Ubuntu environment ####

In this task, you'll set up your **Ubuntu** 14.04 environment by installing **ASP.NET Core 1.0** dependencies, as well as **Visual Studio Code**, **Yeoman** and the **ASP.NET generator**.

1. Install the dependencies for the **.NET Version Manager (DNVM)** by executing the following commands in a terminal.

1. Now, install **Yeoman** and the **ASP.NET generator** using npm by executing the following command in a terminal.

	````
	sudo npm install -g yo generator-aspnet
	````

#### Task 2 - Creating a ASP.NET Core 1.0 application using Yeoman ####

**Yeoman** helps you to kickstart new projects, prescribing best practices and tools to help you stay productive.

To do so, it provides a generator ecosystem. A generator is basically a plugin that can be run with the `yo` command to scaffold complete projects or useful parts. By creating the **ASP.NET Core 1.0** generator, the goal is to provide an experience consistent with creating new ASP.NET Core projects and files in Visual Studio 2015.

In this task, you'll create a **ASP.NET Core 1.0** web application using **Yeoman** and the **ASP.NET generator**.

1. Open a terminal and run the following command.

	````
	yo aspnet
	````

1. Select the **Web Application** option.

1. Next, you'll be prompted to name your application. Change the default name to use _MyWebApp_.

	````
	? What's the name of your ASP.NET application? (WebApplication)
	````

1. On proceeding, the generator will create an application similar to the one created in **Windows** with **Visual Studio**. If you execute the **tree** command you'll see an output similar to the following.

	````
	.
	├─── Controllers
	├─── Migrations
	├─── Models
	├─── Services
	├─── ViewModels
	│    ├─── Account
	│    └─── Manage
	├─── Views
	│    ├─── Account
	│    ├─── Home
	│    ├─── Manage
	│    └─── Shared
	└─── wwwroot
		  ├─── css
		  ├─── images
		  └─── js

	16 directories, 72 files
	````

1. Restore the dependencies running the following commands in the terminal.

	````
	cd "MyWebApp"
	dnu restore
	````

#### Task 3 - Opening the site in VS Code ####

**Visual Studio Code** is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications. Additionally, it's free and available on your favorite platform - Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows.

In this task, you'll open and run the generated **ASP.NET Core 1.0** web application using **Visual Studio Code**.

1. Open Visual Studio Code and select **File > Open Folder...** in the top menu to open the folder where you generated the project. When VS Code sees the project.json it will load it.

1. Open the **Startup.cs** file and explore the different features that VS Code gives you like **IntelliSense** or features that traditionally found only in IDEs, such as **Outlining**, **Find All References**, and **Go To Definition**.

	_Exploring the VS Code features_

1. Open the **project.json** file and locate the **commands** node. you'll find two commands: **web** and **ef**.

	````
	"commands": {
	  "web": "Microsoft.AspNet.Server.Kestrel",
	  "ef": "EntityFramework.Commands"
	}
	````

1. To execute the available commands, right-click the **project.json** file and select **Open in Terminal** to open a terminal where the file is located.

1. Next, run the Web site by executing the **dnx web** command in the terminal.

1. Open your favorite browser and browse to **http://localhost:5000** to browse the site created.
